# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 05, 2017 @ 2 hours.
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Mainly starting the challenge, working on fully understanding reduce. Complete symmetric difference challenge from FCC.

**Today's Side Progress**: 
1) Check pre HTML tag, The pre tag defines preformatted text. Text in a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks.


**Thoughts:** First day of the 100 days of code challange. For this challenge, I want to focus on HTML, CSS and JavaScript, mainly via FCC.
